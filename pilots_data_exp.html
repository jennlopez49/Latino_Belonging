<h1>Treatments &amp; Manipulation Check — What did you just read about?</h1>
<p>Control Policy - Consider the following policy proposal that could be implemented in your state: A recent policy proposal in your state would create a working group to analyze whether the current state flower should be kept, or whether other native flowers should be designated as the state flower. The proposed working group would invite high school students and those who work in botanical gardens to conduct research on native flowers and submit proposals on their recommendations for the state flower designation.</p>
<p>Treatment (Pro-Immigrant) - Consider the following policy proposal that could be implemented in your state: A recent policy proposal in your state would remove the requirement for hospitals to ask their patients about their immigration status. Opponents argue that the policy is necessary to track what is being spent providing undocumented immigrants with medical care. Supporters argue that it would encourage immigrants to seek medical care, and that the policy will help people access public services.</p>
<p>Treatment (Anti-immigrant) - Consider the following policy proposal that could be implemented in your state: This policy proposal would require hospitals to ask their patients about their immigration status. Supporters argue that the policy is necessary to track what is being spent to provide unauthorized immigrants with medical care to prevent them from “cheating the system.” Opponents argue that it would discourage immigrants from seeking medical care, and that the policy is an attempt to scare people into not using public services.</p>
<p><em>For the question - what did you just read about?</em></p>
<p>0 - Chose “None of these” or “Gun Control”</p>
<p>1 - Was in the Control Group and Chose “State Symbols”</p>
<p>2 - Was in either of the Hypothetical Policy Treatment Groups and Chose “Immigration”</p>
<p>3 - Was in either of the Hypothetical Policy Treatment Groups and Chose “Healthcare”</p>

home and not feel like I have to just play along with what everyone around me
is saying thinking doing and believing just so that I can be a 'Pennsylvanian.'

was at home in the deepest parts of my heart and soul in my time living here,

<p>Thoughts on open-ended questions: people provided “real” answers, and for some, it seemed like that the questions were on topics that they wanted to discuss. The questions on belonging to me seemed to be produce more useful or thought-provoking answers that can shed light on that question of how immigration is affecting people psychologically. The participation question did get some good answers reflecting efficacy (worry about the community &amp; wanting to do more or expressing hopelessness), but many were along the vein of “no, already have enough information” or “would like to seek that information on my own.”</p>
